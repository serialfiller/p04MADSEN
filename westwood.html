  <h2>OVERVIEW: </h2>
  <p>Westwood's Punk is an excerpt from a piece that describes the work of fashion designer
    Vivienne Westwood, and outlines the influence she has had on the punk subculture through her art. Non-fictional.

    <h1>Punks }</h1> </div>

  <div id="column1"><p>Like trends, fashion designers come and go. With the constantly evolving tastes of consumers, to remain noteworthy can be quite challenging. Yet what some (and maybe only few) designers manage is to make a lasting mark on the industry. Dame Vivienne Westwood is a British fashion designer. She is best known for providing the iconic punk image to clothing. Westwood
  found success by applying her fundamental design principles (rebellion meets traditional tailoring) and catering
  it to the demands of her audience.  <br><br>[...continued...]</p>

	<p>However, Westwood managed to successfully continue in fashion.
        Starting a clothing brand under her own name, <i>Vivienne Westwood</i>,
        she remarketed her designs in a new direction. Her clothing line took on a more romantic aesthetic,
        while it stayed true to her eccentric self. As Cathy Horyn from <i>The New Yorker</i> describes: "In the 80's, shifting dramatically,
        she caught the first wave of nostalgia for the England of formal rooms and misty landscapes, pink-coated ladies
        riding to hounds, demented old aristocrats in moldering tweeds -- and sexpots in flaring crinolines."
         </p>

<p>Despite the challenges of working within a fickle industry, Westwood has managed to build a successful
        empire around her clothing.
        To achieve this, Westwood has continuously rebranded her
line in new ways to maintain the interest of her audience. Starting from the <i>Vivienne Westwood</i> line's
first catwalk collection in 1981, she has divided her work into what she titles periods.
Each period covers roughly a decade, and is a series of collections where "the ideas carry through (Westwood)".
The rebellious nature of her clothing is constant, yet she has reworked and expanded upon her brand to
remain relevant to the genres and cultures of the time. </p>

  </div>
  
  <div id="column2">	<p>Although her subsequent directions have not been as influential or
  as recognized as her punk clothing, she has remained significant in fashion.
  Her unconventional creations have an authentic appeal, and her underlying design
  ethos to challenge the norm has always remained the same. Yet, Westwood has recognized the
  value in recreating one's work to stay in demand. Further, she has found opportunity by catering to
  consumer wants in areas not yet approached by other designers. The recent underwear as outerwear trend was
  a result of Westwood's work. Although clothing with a boudoir aesthetic had been done before
  (think anything Madonna during the 80's), it was Westwood that came
  up with the contemporary approach to create elegant outerwear with obvious references to lingerie.
  This look has since been repeated throughout high fashion.  <br><br>[...continued...]</p>

<p>Vivienne Westwood shows both innovation and creativity.
She found success by channelling these skills through viable avenues in the marketplace.
Rather than hope for demand to follow, Westwood sought out demand and filled the void.
With her punk line, the void represented a sociocultural movement that did not yet have a symbolic outlet.
As a result, the significance of her designs was deeply rooted. Thus, her creations became iconic to punk,
and historical to fashion. }} </p>
